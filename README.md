## Guardian Nodes 🛡️

Sitting above the PoP nodes, Guardian Nodes act like watchdogs. They continuously monitor network health, gather telemetry data, and optimize routing to ensure users get the fastest and most reliable data paths.

## How it Works 🔍

Guardian Nodes collect real-time metrics like latency, bandwidth, and uptime from PoP nodes.
With these insights, they can reroute traffic dynamically to avoid bottlenecks, improving overall network performance. 🚀

## OKE its enough for that intro , lets dive into the code. I will show you how to deploy a simple Guardian Node using CLI BETA VERSION
